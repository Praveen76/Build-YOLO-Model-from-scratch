# Build YOLO Model from Scratch

## Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Understand Object Detection:**
    - Gain a clear understanding of the concept of object detection in computer vision.

2. **Configure YOLO V3:**
    - Learn to configure and implement YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 3, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.

3. **Make Inferences from YOLO on Real-time Images:**
    - Acquire the skills to make real-time inferences using the YOLO model on images.

## Files Contained in the Project:

- **`Build_YOLO_Model_from_scratch.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the project implementation and experimentation.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-YOLO-Model-from-scratch.git
cd Build-YOLO-Model-from-scratch
```

2. Open and explore the Jupyter notebook `Build_YOLO_Model_from_scratch.ipynb` to understand the project implementation.

3. Execute the code cells within the notebook to experiment with building a YOLO model from scratch.

4. Gain practical experience in configuring YOLO V3 and making real-time inferences.
